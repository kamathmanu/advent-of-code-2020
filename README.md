# Advent of Code 2020 Solutions

My personal solutions for Advent of Code 2020. I've attempted these in Python & C++.

All source code is located in the *src/* directory; each day is self-contained (eg. for CMake) and solution source code is split by language as well.

The *recap/* directory contains my "trip-report" of the experience. I describe the main concepts of each problem, what I found notable about a given day, what I struggled with, etc. In addition, I document other useful stuff I learnt (plus examples to reinforce concepts).
