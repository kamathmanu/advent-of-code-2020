# Recap: Days 1 - 3

## Day 1

1. Parsing input was (and remained) a unique part of AoC that I hadn't encountered in similar competetive programming-styled questions (LeetCode for example, doesn't bother with this). For the initial days, this was not anything complicated or tedious at all. But I found the repeatedly writing the same code ingrained the habit of parsing the input in my head. In particular, when parsing you start to relate what you need for your algorithmic solution to how you must parse data to best fit your needs. My speed when it came to parsing such trivial stuff significantly increased after a couple days of practice.

2. This was my first taste of using C++20's ranges (albeit, I used the range-v3 library since it isn't supported on my compiler yet.) I definitely need to completely understand what ranges, views and adapters are, although the general idea is intuitive enough. While not as terse as Python, they do simplify a lot of otherwise-convoluted boilerplate C++ code, and are especially useful for parsing input.

3. The algorithms for this puzzle were nice review: two sum was simple enough. Doing this problem twice in 2 languages really consolidated the O(N^2) solution to 3-Sum for me. In particular, we simply view 3-sum as a generalization of 2 sum, where we fix a given number and find the 2 sum for that number. The trick is to sort the numbers so that we can use an efficient two pointer approach, thereby reducing it from an N^3 to N^2 solution.

4. Lastly, this was a good practice of tooling in C++. Although I knew CMake generally, I would only sporadically change CMakeLists.txt and other build related files so this day started a habit of reinforcing my knowledge of CMake, Conan and making builds easy for C++.

All in all, a good start to Advent of Code.

## Day 2

This day was actually not particularly interesting, at least algorithmically. However, there was a few neat things to pick up.

1. I got introduced to the idea of generators in Python; I'd known about list comprehensions, but didn't know that generators were the generalizaed version and could provide more efficiency. More on generators on Day 3!

2. C++ gives me a good chance to practice some STL algorithms!
  i. `ranges::views::split` makes tokenizing the string extremely easy. Previously, the alternative would have been to use *getline* *stringstream*, or to use Boost's split. See more [here](https://www.fluentcpp.com/2017/04/21/how-to-split-a-string-in-c/).
  ii. `std::count`/`std::count_if` (and the range-based equivalents) are the correct algorithm here.
3. In both the Python and C++ solutions, note how using the right form of abstraction makes Part 2 a trivial variation of Part 1. Of course, in this problem this is quite easy to do, it may not always be so convenient to find this.

## Day 3

This was also a fairly straightforward day, but I learned some neat stuff for C++!

- The main catch/idea is to recognize the modular form of the columns, and "wrap" the columns.
- Expanding from Day 2, Python generators are awesome! Read: [PEP-0289](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0289/)
- Doing this in C++ gave me a nice chance to practice STL algos:
  - Like day 2, the `count_*` algos make the most sense, as we count if the relevant cell `pattern[down][right]` is a '#', but iterating through the grid and accessing the relevant cell is a bit more work.
  - Start with the raw loops solution (as done in my Python solution). If you're not immediately able to come up with an STL algo solution, code the raw loops solution to get something working fast, and then regroup and evaluate what algorithmic idea you are trying to express.
  - Here, we see that we are iterating through a for/while-loop; `down` iterates depending on the y-coord of the slope. Likewise, we access the column `right` by *repeatedly adding* (read: scalar multipliction) the x-coord of the slope.
  - Now we can see how to apply STL algos. `std::iota` is extremely useful, because it lets us construct an iterator range of indices we need for `down` (NOTE: pass parameters as type int). We then pipe that to `ranges::views::stride`. While not yet a part of C++20's ranges yet, this function is extremely useful and let's us iterate through the loop in different strides, which is useful for generalizing for part 2. Finally we use the predicate for the `count_if`.
  - The last catch is that now that we cannot keep adding `right` as I did in the raw-loop solution; however note we can access the index since it predictably jumps across based on the row, and the slope/trajectory. The inverse of the mathematical slope gives us the ratio of the horizontal movement, so row * slope.x / slope.y gives us the column - and we mod it by N to maintain the modular pattern.
  - Part 2 follows the map-reduce paradigm. Good stuff.

A great day to practice C++ STL algos, and explore some details for both languages.
