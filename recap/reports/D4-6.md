# Recap: Days 4 - 6

## Day 4

Didn't bother with C++ for this.

- Again, parsing is the trick. Learning how to recognize certain delimiters helps here (eg. '\n\n').
- Using sets/dictionaries for each passport *should* be fine - algorithmically, this is O(1). I would imagine
profiling would be useful to check if it is a bottleneck in performance.
- Rather than use the strategy of converting the filter to a list. The Pythonic way is to use a list comprehension, but again
this doesn't solve the issue of wasting the lazy nature of filter. This is really a good use case for the **map-reduce** (or map-filter in this case) ideology (and which may be better especially in other languages). For Python, another [possible solution](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50852721) would involve using `sum` with generators, although this *might* actually end up being a bit slower.
- The other neat trick I realized was that you can use lambdas in dictionaries! For part 2 this greatly simplifies the code. The dict combines the set functionality (unordered, fast access of unique keys) and can validate the regex by using lambdas that take the expression and validate it to return a boolean.
- Lastly, brush up on your regex! It's the kind of tool you would not want to use, until you do and then it ends up being very useful (especially when you wanna hack stuff quickly and not worry about performance). Note here we had to use `re.fullmatch` because we want to validate the fields entirely as opposed to receiving a partial match, which would be incorrect.

## Day 5

I didn't bother with C++ for this one. The algorithmic problem has some noteworthy lessons:

- Part 1 feels very much like binary search, because it is (kinda). However, we don't actually need to perform the pseudo binary search. Note that the boarding pass is a *binary* string, as in it uses only 2 characters F & B. So, it suffices to simply convert the F's and B's to 0s and 1s and then convert it to binary. This is an O(s) solution, where s is the length of the string. However, note that s is bounded since there's only 128 seats. Also, the conversion of the str to binary int may have some constant factors that may slow it down, but again that isn't a big deal unless profiling shows it to be so.
- The other major idea of part 1 is the continuation to part 2: note the idea of Alexander A Stepanov's *["Law of Useful Return"*](https://rksouthee.github.io/2019/10/27/the-law-of-useful-return.html)*: we return all potentially useful information from part 1, notably ids, smallest and largest which is reused in part 2. (In this case, it is kind of trivial to compute smallest and largest, but this habit might save one from having to recompute ids).
- Part 2 wasn't the most space-efficient solution, but it was eash to convert to a set. However, this problem is something you must definitely revisit as it is nearly identical to one of [Stripe's interview questions](https://cppcodingzen.com/?p=383).

## Day 6

- I did this all wrong! This question is actually a great example of using set algorithms smartly to simplify your solution.
- The ideal Python solution uses these algorithms. For part 1, it's kind of a parsing issue as we first split by the blank line, and then construct a set for each group by remove any newline spaces and converting it to one run-on string. Part 2 is the perfect example of using set intersection to find the common answer! We first split the various answers by people, and create a set for the letters for each of the tokens, and then find the intersection/common answers. Finally, we want the number of common answers (i.e. elements in the intersecting set). Pretty neat stuff.
- Doing this in C++ is something I'm still struggling with - it's mostly the parsing. For now, an interim solution parses the file by lines (we sort the characters as a freebie) and then splits every character in groups based on the newline delimiter elements. The next parts (before accumulating the answers to each part) are EXTREMELY englightening:
  - For Part 1, we simply convert each group into the concatenated string of answers, then sort them and uniquify **(Q: Why must we do it in that order?)**.
  - For Part 2, we can use `ranges::front` & `ranges::tail` which effectively `car` & `cdr` our range, respectively. We then repeatedly apply the set intersection algorithm to the `cdr` of the remaining range and then get the number of interesting answers by using `ranges::distance`.

This was a great day. The algorithm exposed a weak link since I hadn't applied set algorithms in practice before. The C++ implementation also taught me a lot of new things. Given that I didn't come up with it, I'll definitely have to practice this under pressure a few more times to test my understanding.
